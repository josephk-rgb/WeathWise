# Part 12: Monitoring, Analytics & Optimization

## 12.1 Overview

This section covers best practices and implementation details for monitoring application health, tracking analytics, and optimizing performance for the WeathWise platform. These strategies ensure reliability, scalability, and actionable insights for both developers and users.

---

## 12.2 Monitoring

### Application Monitoring
- **Backend**: Integrate tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog to monitor API latency, error rates, and resource usage.
- **Frontend**: Use Sentry or LogRocket for real-time error tracking and user session replay.
- **ML Services**: Monitor model inference times, resource consumption, and error logs using custom logging or ML-specific tools (e.g., MLflow).

### Health Checks
- Implement periodic health checks for backend services and ML endpoints.
- Use automated alerts for downtime or abnormal behavior.

---

## 12.3 Analytics

### User Analytics
- Integrate Google Analytics or Plausible for tracking user engagement, retention, and conversion rates.
- Use custom event tracking for key actions (e.g., portfolio updates, chat interactions).

### Financial Analytics
- Track portfolio performance, investment returns, and risk metrics.
- Visualize financial health scores and trends using dashboard charts.

---

## 12.4 Optimization

### Performance Optimization
- **Backend**: Profile API endpoints, optimize database queries, and use caching (Redis, in-memory) for frequently accessed data.
- **Frontend**: Lazy-load components, optimize bundle size, and leverage browser caching.
- **ML Services**: Batch requests, use model quantization, and optimize inference pipelines.

### Cost Optimization
- Monitor cloud resource usage and scale services based on demand.
- Use serverless functions for infrequent or burst workloads.
